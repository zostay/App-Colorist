# Since not everyone likes the same colors. The keys here depend on the ruleset
# (named in the arrays following each regex). The values define the color to
# use for that rule keyword as follows:
#
#  * no color: To make no special color for that title use ~ (undef)
#  * foreground color: To set only the foreground color, provide the name,
#    index, or array look up described below for colors to define them.
#  * foreground & background color: You need to provide a hash with two keys:
#    "fg" and "bg". Each of these keys is set to the color name, index, or
#    array lookup.
#
# For example:
#
#     DEFAULT: ~
#     name: ~
#     url: white
#     title: { fg: ~, bg: purple }
#     spam: [ 14 ]
#     calamity: { fg: [ 1, 1, 3 ], bg [ 0, 0, 1 ] }
#
# Here "name" is given no extra color, "url" will have white text in the
# foreground, "title" is printed on a purple background, "spam" will be a shade
# of gray tending toward white on a 256 color screen, and "calamity" will be a
# shade of blue gray in the foreground on a background of dark green on a 256
# color screen.
# 
# There is also one special key, "DEFAULT", which can be given a foreground and
# or background color to give everything unmatched a color of your choice.
#
# Colors are named like this:
#
# For standard ANSI colors:
#  * black  (0)     * gray    (8)
#  * maroon (1)     * red     (9)
#  * green  (2)     * lime    (10)
#  * olive  (3)     * yellow  (11)
#  * navy   (4)     * blue    (12)
#  * purple (5)     * fuschia (13)
#  * teal   (6)     * aqua    (14)
#  * silver (7)     * white   (15)
#
# If you use a 256 color terminal additional colors are available as follows.
# Shades of gray are available by putting a single value inside an array like
# this, where 0 is black and 23 is white (and all values in between are a shade
# of gray).
#
#  * [ 0 ]
#  * ...
#  * [ 11 ]
#  * ...
#  * [ 23 ]
#
# For RGB colors, you can use the following:
#
#  * [ r, g, b ]
#
# A three-element array is interpreted as an RGB lookup. The number of colors
# is limited to 216, so the range of r, g, and b must be 0 .. 5. 
#
# The final alternative is to use the color index directly. Manually
# calculating the index for 256 colors works as follows:
#
# gray(i)      = 232 + i
# rgb(r, g, b) = 16 + 36*r + 6*g + b
